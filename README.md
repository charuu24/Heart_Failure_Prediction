# Heart Failure Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Problem Definition - 

    • Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for 32% of global deaths.

    • Therefore to identify people having heart disease we are using data analysis and ML model for prediction.

    • We are predicting whether a person has heart disease or not through various ml models.

Motivation -

    • As already stated in our problem statement, this model helps in predicting whether a person has heart disease or not.
    • Currently, the world is facing the devastating effects of COVID-19, which has had a significant impact on the global economy, health.
    • By using the data analysis and machine learning model we will be predicting whether a person has heart disease or not based on 15 attributes. It helps in early detection of heart disease.

The objective of the Project -

    The Project is based on a machine learning model that can predict if a person has a heart disease or not.

Scope of the Project - 

    The scope of the project is very vast, as it can be used in early detection of heart disease which helps in reducing the death rate due to heart diseases.

Need of Work -  

    The objective of this work is early detection of heart disease. It improves accuracy and helps individuals to get personalized treatments. It further reduces healthcare costs.
